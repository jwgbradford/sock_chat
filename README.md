# Simple socket-based chat app for python

This mini-project introduces sockets and a very simple client server method.

# Version 1
The first part is to code the server.py and client.py
This gives a server & one client.
Both server and client can type messages in and send them back and forth.

# Version 2
This adds threading to the server so that you can have two clients
Have to send a message to receive, because we're using the command line
Still very simple message passing.

# Version 3
Uses tkinter to add asynchronous messaging, each client can receive messages as they are sent.

# Known issues
1) doesn't close down neatly, broken pipe errors
